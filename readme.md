# Python Dev Series

This project is inspired by [betterpython](https://github.com/ArjanCodes/betterpython) from 
[ArjanCodes](https://github.com/ArjanCodes). I consider it a good Python learning path. In this repository I rebuild his examples step by step and document my findings on
[my blog](https://www.blogdan.site/) under the title Python Dev Series.
